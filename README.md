Squat-Detection
This project helps in classifying a video image frame in to "squat" or "no squat". It uses VGG16 architecture as a feature extractor
and LSTM architecture as a binary classifier. All the codes were implemented on Google-Colaboratory. 
The first step inludes generation of image frames from training video data set.Use the file "image_frames_generation.py" to store 
video image frames in .jpeg format. All these are stored in a folder "frames". For this use the command "!mkdir frames" and use the 
appropriate folder path in the above python file.
The next step is to zip the folder and download it. For this use the file "
